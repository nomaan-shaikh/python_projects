# Suppose that you were painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
# Given a random height and width of wall, write a python code to calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.
